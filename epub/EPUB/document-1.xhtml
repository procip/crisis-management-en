      <p>Crisis Management</p>
      <p>Textbook for Public Health Services</p>
      <p>Edited by Ute Teichert &amp; Peter Tinnemann</p>
      <p>v1.0, 2021</p>
      <h2 id="H6627615">Pre-release v1.0</h2>
      <p>In recent years, crisis management is gaining considerably in importance, in the public health services in general and in particular since the SARS-CoV-II pandemic globally. In Germany, decision-making authority for crisis management of biological emergencies resides in principle with the municipal health authorities.</p>
      <p><strong>In light of the current situation (as of 31 March 2020) involving the spread of the novel coronavirus, we are hereby providing extracts from a preliminary version of our textbook (Krisenmanagement) open-access in English to a global audience.</strong></p>
      <p>Crisis management tools support staff in the public health services to ensure that the authorities are able to continue functioning in biological emergencies. As a rule, normal administrative structures cannot cope with the challenges that arise in a crisis. Information and communications management for example must be adapted if it is to cope with increased demands. If sufficient specialist personnel are not available, competences have to be pooled and provided from a more central point. This textbook is designed to provide employees of public health offices, as well as other public health institutions, with pointers on how to systematically prepare themselves for preventing hazards in case of crisis, and familiarise them with the basics of crisis management. As well as covering specialised aspects, the textbook also provides recommendations in particular on operational planning and working in teams. It is supplemented with checklists designed and established in practise to serve as practical tools.</p>
      <p>The content brought together in this unique textbook is based on the authors' years of theoretical study and practical experience within public health services. <strong>This textbook is a joint work of all the authors involved, and does not represent the opinion of individual institutions or individual authors.</strong></p>
      <p>We are planning to update and expand this textbook in the future. We would therefore be delighted if you could share with us your suggestions, comments and additions. We are using <strong><a href="https://hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a></strong> for your comments and additions to our textbook.</p>

      <h3 id="H2766812">Sustainability and further development</h3>
      <p>The product of this collaborative writing process has been and will continue to be supplemented and improved. Here, readers too can also play an active role by providing their feedback and addenda. The authors of all the texts are conscious of the fact that the themes covered so far represent only segments of the range of activities performed by public health services.</p>
      <p>Sine this is an agile project that will be continuously developed together with the Academy of Public Health Services, as well as continuously updating the existing chapters it will also be possible to add further thematic areas.</p>
      <h3 id="H99013">Method</h3>
      <p>All texts were developed and written using the so-called <strong>book sprint</strong> method. A <strong>book sprint</strong> is an agile method that enables authors to collaboratively write longer and more complex texts in a short period of time. All books sprints were organised and carried out jointly by the Academy of Public Health Services and the Open Science Lab of the TIB – Leibniz-Information Centre for Science and Technology</p>
      <p>University Library. The book sprint method enables authors to create digital content on a goal-oriented basis.</p>
      <p>It is based on the principles of sharing, co-development, community building and collective ownership of the product. This open, transparent method has already been successfully used at several institutions, including the TIB. It is based on goal-competence profiles defined in advance, on teaching modules that have been tried and tested in prior teaching settings, and on practical examples of application (use cases).</p>
      <p>Authors use digital technologies to write the content This enables a joint process of concurrently writing texts which are designed as a single collectively owned product in their entirety, until then final result is achieved. Chapters or entire books are written in this manner. In intensive three-day book sprints we have worked with up to ten experts on a selected topic Facilitated by a book sprint moderator with experience in media education, participants create joint content on selected topics related to work in the public health service.</p>
      <h3 id="H691848">How the textbook was produced</h3>
      <p>This original textbook Krisenmanaement was a joint project of the <a href="https://www.akademie-oegw.de/startseite.html" title="https://www.akademie-oegw.de/startseite.html">Academy of Public Health Services</a> and the <a href="https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/open-science">Open Science Lab</a> of the <a href="https://www.tib.eu/" title="https://www.tib.eu/">TIB</a> – Leibniz-Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.</p>
      <p>Together with teachers from the Academy, experts from different fields of public health have been co-authoring texts for this series of textbooks in book sprints since 2019.</p>
      <p>The initial phase of collaborative writing was followed by an editing phase during which supplemental content was inserted and existing content revised. The text contributions are based on a broad range of relevant literature, years of experience gained by long-standing public health practitioners, and experiences and suggestions put forward by young professionals with an interest in public health.</p>
      <p> In all the textbooks, jointly defined chapters on e.g. history, objectives, tasks, structures and definitions are described in detail. Each book has been designed as a comprehensive, self-contained work, and can be read either in conjunction with the other books or as a stand-alone reference work in its own right.</p>
      <p>The entire textbook series is designed as an Open Educational Resource (OER) and is published under an open licence. This allows free access, editing and further processing by others without restriction or with only minor restrictions.</p>
      <p>The original textbook in German and the this textbook will be updated and is available as a printed textbook at a reasonable price.</p>
